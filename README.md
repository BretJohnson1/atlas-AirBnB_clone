                      AIRBNB CONSOLE

            A custom console designed for AirBnB

This command line interpreter for our AirBnB serves as a powerful tool that allows users to interact with the system using textual command. This interpreter enables users to perform various operations such as adding new places, managing user profiles, requesting information about specific locations and writing reviews. By providing a straight forward interface for managing the backend functionalities of an AirBnB-like application, the command-line interpreter enhances efficiency and flexibility for developers and administrators, streamlining the process of maintaining and scaling the platform.
